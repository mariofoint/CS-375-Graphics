I picked a clock that looks cool.
I like 24 hours clock that I can put on second moniter when I am not using it and this seems like a cool thing to pull up. 
The transition between numbers is my favorite part it smooth and intresting to see the number forming.
The choice of black and white is clean would like options but the black and white stands out.
It simple but it is cool to watch and something that I can use functionally.
